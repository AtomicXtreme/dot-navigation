# Required page options and attributes

The following are options that each page should define in the configuration

* `label` - the text of the menu item
* `route` or `uri` - defines the route or link the menu item will have
* `permission` - can be used optionally, if authorization service is present, in order to omit menu items that are not authorized to visit.
